# Simon-Game

A fun, memory-based game that challenges players to repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. This self-learning project was built to apply and strengthen my web development skills using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

## Problem Statement

Classic memory games like Simon challenge the brain while being fun and addictive. This project aims to recreate the Simon Game as an engaging web-based experience, helping users improve memory and focus, while allowing me to reinforce my knowledge of JavaScript, event handling, animations, and DOM manipulation.

---

## Approach

The game was implemented entirely on the front-end using:

* **HTML**: For structure and layout
* **CSS**: For styling and animations
* **JavaScript**: For game logic and state management
* **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM element selection and event binding

---

## Features

* Color and sound-based sequence repetition game
* Increasing difficulty with each level
* Visual feedback for correct and incorrect input
* Restart option after a game over
* Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile

---

## Prerequisites

No special installations are needed to run the game—just a modern web browser.

For development purposes:

* A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
* Live Server extension (optional for auto-refresh during development)

---

## Setup and Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd simon-game
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a live server for development.

No additional installations or build tools are required.

---

## Commands

Since this is a front-end project, there are no specific npm or CLI commands. Just open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.

---

## Usage

Once the game is loaded:

* Press any key to start.
* A color will flash—repeat the sequence by clicking the correct buttons.
* With each level, a new color is added to the sequence.
* If you press the wrong color, the game resets and displays a game-over message.
* Press any key again to restart and try to beat your high score!
